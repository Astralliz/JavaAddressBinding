Program 1: "Program Name"
- This program demonstrates method overloading or compile-time binding. In the "Compare" class, the "compare()" method checks if the values determined by its parameters, is equal. This function allows one single method to be reused indefinitely just by changing its parameters.

Program 2: "Basic Arithmetic Operations"
- This program demonstrates method overriding or run-time binding. Each class offers a unique implementation of the calculate() method, enabling various basic arithmetic operations to be performed using a single method.
